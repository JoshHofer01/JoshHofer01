## About Me:
I am a First-Class Honours graduate from Staffordshire University, with a strong focus on pursuing a career in Software Engineering. My journey into this field has been marked by notable achievements, including excelling in Harvardâ€™s CS50 courses, and achieving a remarkable 97% performance in the HyperionDev bootcamp.

## My Projects:
My <a href="https://github.com/JoshHofer01?tab=repositories" title="Josh's profile overview">projects</a> reflect my dedication to learning and applying my skills in real-world scenarios. For instance, "LYRICA" is a **full-stack** application I developed for my CS50X Final Project, utilizing **Flask, Python, SQLite3, JavaScript, HTML, CSS,** aswell as integrating external APIs.
